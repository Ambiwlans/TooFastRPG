J->E translation/localization patch for 速すぎるRPG

A quick translation for a silly RPG made by KSB.

The original can be found "https://www.freem.ne.jp/win/game/23390".

I have recieved permission to do the English translation and distribute the game, if you want to modify the game for yourself, please contact KSB as he controls all rights to the game.

I ended up using Translation++ and making an English patch for the game rather than adding multilanguage support to the base game, sadly, the pre-existing plugins enabling multiple languages were either too buggy to use, or insufficient.

Please contact me here, or via udp.castellani@gmail.com if you find any bugs or otherwise need to contact me.

----------------

TooFast RPG is a rather silly game making fun of RPG tropes. The whole game only takes about an hour.

Have fun!
